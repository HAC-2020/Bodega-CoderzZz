# Speach to Text with gRPC

- A gRPC-server which takes audio as input from itâ€™s client and sends it to Google-Cloud-Speech API
- The Cloud-Speech API transcribes this audio to text and sends it back to the server
- This text is then sent back to the client.
- The client-server pair has bi-directional stream of data where audio is converted to text in real time and displayed word for word.
